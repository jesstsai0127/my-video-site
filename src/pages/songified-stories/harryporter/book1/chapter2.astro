const transcript = `A cupboard door that creaks at dawn,
Dust and dreams he sleeps upon.
The light slips in through cracks so thin,
Another day of holding in.

He counts the steps outside his bed,
Before they shout and shake his head.
The breakfast burns, the dishes clink,
He disappears before they blink.
A boy behind their backs, unseen,
With secondhand clothes and silent dreams.
The birthday cake is not for him,
He fades like walls that once were dim.

The zoo was loud, the glass was thick,
But something in him twitched and clicked.
He stared until the glass was gone,
And snake and boy both carried on.
"Thanks," it hissed, and he stepped back,
As if he'd walked a secret track.
They blamed his face, they cursed his name,
But deep inside, he felt no shame.

He doesn’t know the “how” or “why,”
Just the way the air had sighed.
He felt the world beneath his skin,
A whisper that began within.
Not rage, not pride — just something true,
That didn't fit the life he knew.

The car ride home was long and cold,
With silence thick and anger bold.
They locked him in and slammed the door,
Back to the dust, the wooden floor.
Yet in the dark, he smiled small,
As if he'd never feared at all.
For something stirred — a voice, a spark,
A magic blooming in the dark.

He’s more than bruises, more than chores,
More than hiding under floors.
A world unknown is drawing near,
Beyond the glass, beyond the fear.`;
