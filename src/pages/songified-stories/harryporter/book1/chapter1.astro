A cold wind whispered through the night,
Streetlamps blinked beneath the sky.
A cat sat still on Privet Drive,
As secrets stirred where shadows lie.

He came in robes, a crooked hat,
A twinkle deep in tired eyes.
With hands that shook yet held the truth,
He watched the silent, sleeping skies.
The world had changed, a war had closed,
But one small child still breathed, still rose.
The scar upon his brow would mark
The end of dark, the start of hope.

She laid him down with gentle care,
A letter tucked beneath his hand.
The stars looked down on jet-black hair,
The quiet weight of fate unplanned.
He cried but once, then fell asleep,
While owls took flight, the night ran deep.
They left him there, with love and grief,
Upon a porch, beneath belief.

They didn’t know what he would be,
The lightning child, the mystery.
A world would whisper of his name,
But he would grow without the fame.
Behind closed doors, beneath the stairs,
Unknowing yet, of what he bears.
The world moved on, the sky turned gray,
But magic breathed in him that day.

He was the boy who lived through fire,
Who shattered death, denied the pyre.
But for now, he was just a child,
Left to dream in silence, mild.

The cat moved on, the lamplights glowed,
The letter spoke of all they owed.
The night exhaled, the tale begun—
A boy, a scar, a rising sun.
