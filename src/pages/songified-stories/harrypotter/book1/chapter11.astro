const transcript = `Beneath cold sky and golden light,  
A boy takes flight, beyond the fight.

Boots on grass, a chill in air,  
Scar above eyes, wind in hair.  
Crowds awake with roaring breath,  
The field below, a dance with death.  
He grips the broom, not just to win—  
But to prove he’s more than where he’s been.

This sky, this game—it’s where he’s real,  
Where doubt dissolves in spinning wheels.

Chasing the light in a sea of air,  
A seeker born from silent care.  
Through every dive and turning twist,  
He finds himself in freedom’s kiss.  
No spell, no fear, no weight of name—  
Just boy and broom in sky and flame.

Ohhh—he flies…

But danger slinks where banners wave,  
A spell is cast, the broom misbehaves.  
Harry tilts, the crowd holds breath,  
A shadow stalks in silent depth.  
Hermione runs through fire and fear,  
“It's Snape!” she yells, eyes sharp and clear.  
In secret fire, she breaks the chain—  
To keep a friend from falling pain.

The sky was close, then slipped away,  
But friendship fought to let him stay.

Chasing the light while shadows scheme,  
They tried to break his flying dream.  
But friends who burn with loyal fire,  
Can turn a fall into a flyer.  
Through spell and smoke, he finds control—  
A seeker not just chasing gold.

No father’s hand, no safety net,  
But still he rides through every threat.  
Above them all, he loops and veers—  
He is the storm that conquers fears.  
And when the Snitch reflects the sun,  
The boy becomes the chosen one.

The sky is calm, the crowd stands still,  
He caught the light with steady will.  
A boy no more—he took his chance,  
And found his truth inside the dance.

He flies… because he must.`;
