const transcript = `A chill in the stone, the candles sway,  
A shadow moves where none should stray.

Pumpkins flicker, the feast begins,  
Laughter rising in ancient wings.  
But words can wound, and tears will fall,  
A girl alone behind a stall.  
While others cheer, the storm descends,  
And hearts are tested, foes to friends.

A crash, a scream, a name in fear,  
They chose to run, though death was near.

Troll in the shadows, danger's breath,  
Three hearts defy the hand of death.  
In darkest hour, true courage shows,  
Not born of might, but the path they chose.  
A bond is forged through stone and strife,  
A night that knits a thread for life.

Oh-oh-oh, a bond unspoken.

A wand in hand, a trembling shout,  
A troll's foul stench, no easy out.  
A shattered sink, a falling club,  
A risk so reckless, born of love.  
From lonely eyes and hearts estranged,  
The world in minutes, forever changed.

They didn’t pause, they didn’t plan,  
They fought because they simply can.

Troll in the shadows, danger’s breath,  
Three hearts defy the hand of death.  
In darkest hour, true courage shows,  
Not born of might, but the path they chose.  
A bond is forged through stone and strife,  
A night that knits a thread for life.

Not house nor blood defines their fate,  
But what they choose, the love they make.  
A monster down, a promise made,  
That none would face the dark afraid.

Troll in the shadows, but no one’s alone,  
They found a strength they’d never known.

“We did it… together.”`;
