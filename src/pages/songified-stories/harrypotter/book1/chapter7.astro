const transcript = `A candle-lit hall, a thousand eyes,
A name called out, a fate decides.

He stepped through stone beneath a sky of spells,
Echoes of footsteps, his heartbeat swells.
A line of first-years, wide-eyed and still,
The sorting waits, as fate begins to spill.
Old hat upon his messy hair,
It spoke in thoughts, it laid him bare.
“Plenty of courage, I see it in you,”
But Harry feared what it might choose.

Not Slytherin... he begged inside,
His voice unheard, but not denied.

Whispers in the hat, secrets in the thread,
Tales of greatness, of paths not tread.
A boy unsure, yet somehow bold,
Refused the dark, chose heart over gold.
The hall erupts, the choice is made,
Among the brave, his fears now fade.

Oh, oh, oh — the voice inside...

Ghosts float by with glowing grace,
Paintings stare from every space.
The feast begins, but he just stares,
At faces smiling, friendships there.
From lonely cupboard to candlelight,
The world now shifts beneath the night.
He’s not just Harry — he's found a door,
To something bigger than before.

He didn’t know what lay ahead,
But knew he’d never crawl to bed.

Whispers in the hat, echoes of might,
Paths diverging in candlelight.
A boy reborn, a fire lit,
The mark of choice—he didn’t quit.
A home of magic, daring, grace,
He’d finally found his rightful place.

No crown of snakes, no dark disguise,
He turned his face toward open skies.
The voice he feared had shown him why,
He gets to choose how high to fly.
The sorting hat just tipped and smiled,
“You’ll do well,” it softly filed.

Whispers in the hat, no more alone,
He found the courage to make his own.
A name once lost, now proud and bright,
He walks with friends into the night.

“You’ll do well… you’ll do well…”`;
