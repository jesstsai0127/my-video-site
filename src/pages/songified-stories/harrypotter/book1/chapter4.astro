const transcript = `Rain hit the sea-worn boards outside the shack that night,
The wind was howling louder than the lantern light.
A crash like thunder—door blown clean away,
A giant silhouette stepped in, turned night to day.
Uncle’s face went white, Aunt Petunia froze,
Dudley trembled, hiding behind his nose.
But the man just smiled, kind behind the wild,
Spoke like thunder softened by a child.

He said, “Harry, didn’t yeh ever wonder why?
Why the glass shattered, why the owl could fly?”
Hagrid was his name—keeper of a truth untold,
With pockets full of sausages and secrets old.
He handed Harry a crumpled, yellowed page,
A letter long delayed by fear and rage.
“Yer a wizard,” he said, simple and still—
Like a stone tossed gently on a windowsill.

The fire grew warm as the past came undone,
Petunia raged, spilled stories kept from their son.
Vernon barked lies, but Hagrid stood tall,
Snapped a tail on Dudley with no fear at all.
Harry sat quiet, the world turned again,
Years of cupboards and silence starting to end.
No more letters in chimneys or owls in disguise—
Just truth in a storm, and truth never lies.

In the roar of the night, a path came clear,
A world once hidden now drawing near.
No turning back from that final door,
He wasn’t just “Harry” anymore.`;
