const transcript = `A spark in the dark, in a hidden room,  
A secret flame begins to bloom.

In Hagrid's hut beneath the moon,  
A dragon sleeps in its fragile cocoon.  
Ron’s wide eyes, Hermione's frown,  
Harry knows — they can’t back down.  
A riddle in scales, with smoke in its breath,  
A secret cradled, close to death.

The egg has cracked, the game is on,  
Their quiet nights are almost gone.

Fire in the tower, glowing bright,  
Born in shadows, out of sight.  
Rules forgotten in the flame,  
All for a dragon with no name.  
Hearts alight with wild belief,  
But secrets bring the sharpest grief.

Norbert, Norbert… no one must know...

Sneaking past the suits of mail,  
Invisible cloak, a whispered tale.  
A glance, a step — they’re not alone,  
McGonagall’s voice, like breaking stone.  
One moment's thrill, a lifetime cost,  
In chasing fire, what have they lost?

Caught beneath the ancient stars,  
A lie too bold, the risk too far.

Fire in the tower, burning pride,  
Truth and trouble now collide.  
House points vanish in the wind,  
For every thrill, the weight of sin.  
Friendship flickers, courage bends,  
All for the sake of what they defend.

He was never theirs to keep,  
But still they held the fire so deep.  
In midnight skies, the dragon soared,  
While punishment knocked on Hogwarts’ door.  
The thrill, the guilt, the hidden scars —  
They burned as bright as newborn stars.

Fire in the tower, just a spark,  
But it lit the wild within the dark.  
They broke the rules, they paid the price,  
A dragon’s gift, a roll of dice.

And Norbert... was never really gone.`;
