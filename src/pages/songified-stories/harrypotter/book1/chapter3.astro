const transcript = `[Intro]
The wind taps soft on the window pane,
A boy lies still with hope and strain.
The world moves on without his name,
But something stirs — it’s not the same.

[Verse 1]
Each morning starts in dust and grey,
The cupboard door keeps dreams away.
He watches shadows pass him by,
A spark behind his quiet eye.
A letter slips beneath the frame,
He sees it, heart now lit with flame.
But hands too fast and eyes too cold
Will steal the truth before it's told.

[Verse 2]
He counts the cracks along the floor,
The post slips through, then comes no more.
Each try they make to send it near,
Gets chased by fists and eyes of fear.
The chimney coughs, the hallway shakes,
Still every word, the uncle breaks.
But something waits beyond the lies,
A world that sees, a world that tries.

[Bridge]
The silence grows, then breaks again,
A thousand letters in the rain.
He cannot read, he cannot speak,
But in his chest, the silence leaks.
A moment near, a truth so wide —
What if he’s more than what they hide?

[Verse 3]
They flee the town, the streets, the shore,
They lock the doors and bolt the floor.
But still they come — the notes won’t die,
They sail through storms, they fill the sky.
He dreams of ink, of parchment white,
A name that's his, a claim, a light.
And in the dark, with heart set free,
He whispers soft: “Please write to me.”

[Outro]
So much he's missed, so much to learn,
But paper waits and candles burn.
Not just a boy beneath the stair —
Someone out there knows he's there.`;
