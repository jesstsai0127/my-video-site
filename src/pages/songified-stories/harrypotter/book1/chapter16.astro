const transcript = `Stone beneath, the silence breaks,  
A trapdoor waits for fate to wake.

Through the fire, through the night,  
They step where grown wizards fear the light.  
A riddle, a key, a game of chess,  
The path ahead demands no less.  
Books whisper spells from pages old,  
As Fluffy sleeps with secrets untold.  
One wrong step, and all could fall—  
But friendship dares to risk it all.

Below the floor, behind the lore,  
They chase the dark they can't ignore.

Down through the trapdoor, into the flame,  
No turning back, no one's the same.  
A test of wit, of nerve, of heart—  
Together, but each plays a part.  
In shadows deep, they stake their claim,  
For more than glory, more than fame.

Devil’s Snare wraps, its tendrils cold,  
But calm minds keep a tighter hold.  
Keys that fly like metal birds,  
And logic saves with silent words.  
Ron stands tall where others stall,  
The knight who dares to risk it all.  
Each trial deeper than the last—  
But they are forged from what they’ve passed.

It's not the stone that draws them near,  
It’s what they fight, it’s who they fear.

Down through the trapdoor, hearts collide,  
The truth burns brighter than the lies.  
No wand can guide a soul unsure,  
But love and loyalty endure.  
They’re just eleven, still they stand—  
A trio bound by fate's own hand.

Through fire and fear, through traps and flame,  
They seek what hides behind the name.  
The stone, the face behind the mask—  
Not every answer needs be asked.  
What they became beneath the floor,  
Is braver than they were before.

Not for the prize, not for the gold,  
But for a truth the heart can hold.  
They went below, they chose to fight—  
And came back burning with the light.`;
