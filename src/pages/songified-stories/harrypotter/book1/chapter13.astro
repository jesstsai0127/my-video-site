const transcript = `In pages worn and dreams that burn,  
The secret waits for minds to learn.

Through midnight fires and whispering halls,  
They searched for truths in ancient scrolls.  
A name once lost in dusty lines,  
Beneath their fingers, gold defines.  
The Stone of life, the Elixir’s key,  
Hid in the folds of mystery.  
Flamel, immortal, out of lore,  
Guarded secrets, centuries stored.

The pieces click, the truth unchains,  
But darker forces stake their claims.

The Stone of Flame, they hold it tight,  
While shadows crawl through Hogwarts night.  
A name revealed, a power born,  
A mystery cracked, but minds are torn.  
What price for life? What lines are crossed?  
The magic found, but innocence lost.

Nicolas Flamel…  
Nicolas Flamel…

Neville stumbles through the cold,  
Mocked and cursed, his story told.  
But courage sparked behind his eyes,  
While others chased what power hides.  
Snape’s glare burns like secret fire,  
A silent game of dark desire.  
Harry dreams of pain and flame,  
A hooded thief without a name.

A flicker moves behind the veil,  
They’re not alone upon this trail.

The Stone of Flame, they hold it tight,  
While shadows crawl through Hogwarts night.  
A name revealed, a power born,  
A mystery cracked, but minds are torn.  
Through fear and flame, through midnight frost,  
The magic found, but innocence lost.

The Mirror’s gone, the fire still glows,  
What hides beneath the dungeon stones?  
Fluffy sleeps and Flamel’s truth stands —  
Not all who guard have blood on hands.

The Stone remains, unseen, unknown,  
But now they fear they’re not alone.  
A tale that’s old begins to twist,  
The shadows stir beneath the mist.`;
