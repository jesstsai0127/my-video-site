const transcript = `Silver leaves and shifting eyes,  
Midnight paths where danger lies.

Out past the gates and torchlight glow,  
They walked where even brave won’t go.  
Hagrid spoke with voice half-grave,  
Of unicorns and what they gave.  
The woods were black, alive, unknown,  
Each step a whisper, breath alone.  
Malfoy smirked, but fear crept in,  
This was no prank, no schoolyard sin.

Tracks in blood, the trees grow tight—  
What kills a unicorn in moonlight?

In the forest deep and wild,  
Where even centaurs fear the vile.  
Something hunts beneath the shade,  
A shadow born the stars evade.  
Harry stands with fire in chest—  
But even lions must rest.

Even lions… must rest...

The silver blood still marked the ground,  
A lifeline broken, without a sound.  
Then — a figure, hooded, pale,  
Drinking life where light had failed.  
Harry froze, the pain returned,  
His scar aflame, his soul discerned.  
Then came the hooves, a starlit light,  
Firenze struck like dawn through night.

Not all that walks in shadow’s lost,  
But some will drink at any cost.

In the forest deep and wild,  
Where the old and cruel beguile.  
The stars foretold what men ignore—  
The Dark One’s breath returns once more.  
A child marked, a dying light,  
Still dares to stand and fight.

Beneath the trees, fate cracked and bled,  
The past returned, the future fled.  
He knows the face beneath the hood—  
And what he’d choose if he still could.  
Not just a boy, not just a name—  
The forest knows he’s in the game.

The forest watched… and still it knew—  
The darkest paths are made for few.`;
