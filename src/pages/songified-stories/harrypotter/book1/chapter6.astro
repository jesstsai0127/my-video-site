const transcript = `Steam in the morning, bricks still asleep,
The space between worlds, a breath held deep.

He stood with a trolley, alone in the crowd,
The ticket was folded, his heart beating loud.
No one believed him, they never did care,
But something about this place, charged the air.
A mother with ginger hair spoke to her sons,
"Best do it at a bit of a run."
He stared at the bricks, then swallowed the doubt,
One step, two—then the world spun about.

He walked through the wall, where logic had lied,
A platform appeared on the other side.

Through the wall, where no one believes,
Into the smoke and the drifting steam.
A scar and a name, a boy with no past,
Found the future in the thunder that passed.
Through the wall, where magic begins,
With strangers, with trunks, with owls and with whims.

Ohhh—through the wall...

He found an empty seat, wide eyes and awe,
Red hair again, a friendly draw.
"Are you really—?" came the quiet ask,
He nodded once, shed his mask.
Chocolate frogs, and Bertie Bott’s lies,
New names, new truths beneath the skies.
From cupboard to carriage, from bruises to cheers,
He laughed for the first time in years.

He crossed the threshold, not just of stone—
But into a world where he wasn’t alone.

Through the wall, where a whisper became
A song with a name, a soul with no shame.
He’d been forgotten, hidden away—
Now he belongs, come what may.
Through the wall, where his real life spins,
On rails of fate, where magic begins.

Through the wall—not just of brick and stone,
But the silence, the doubt, the fear of alone.
With Ron, with sweets, with talk of a hat,
And spells he never thought he could cast.
He watched the fields blur past the glass,
And felt—for once—the present could last.

Through the wall, he found the light,
Left behind the lonely night.
No turning back, no need to hide—
He’s on the train, with stars to ride.

He's on the train... with stars to ride.`;
